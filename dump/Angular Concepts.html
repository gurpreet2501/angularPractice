// Angular Concepts
// 1. Controller - Mapping between view to send and receive data. two way binding.
// 2. Directives are basically the html part. Like in fixt we created map directive and on dashboard two directives are build one for open jobs and one for scheduled
// 3. Factories are basically helpers. We can use factories as dependencies in controllers and directives.

// eg. 
angular.module('moduleName',['dependencies']);

// Module dependencies can be other modules only. Factories or any services cant be the dependencies of the modules.

// lets talk about factories

// Factories are just like helpers in codeignitor as we have discussed above. 

// they are used for calculation and other work. The functions in factories receive arguments and return accordingly.

// then these factories can be used as dependencies in controllers , and other directives where we need them.

// Lets take a look

  angular.module('testApp.factories').factory('api',[function(){
    var fac = {
      getUser: function(userID){
        return {
          first_name  : "Gurpreet",
          last_name   : "Singh"
        };
      },
      
      getUserFirstname : function(userID){
        var user = fac.getUser(userID)
        return user.first_name;
      },
      
    };
    
    return fac;
    
  }]);              

  // The above code is a single factory.

  var ctrl = angular.module('testApp.controllers');  
                
  ctrl.controller('homeCtrl',['api','$scope', function(api, $scope){
    
    $scope.hello = 'World!';
    $scope.user = api.getUser(12);
    
  }]);

// In the homeCtrl we have used the api factory as its dependency.
